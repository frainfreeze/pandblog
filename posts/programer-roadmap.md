## What is this?
This is my personal multi-year study plan for going from full stack developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to software engineer for a large company (again self-taught, but with CS degree). [My CV.](http://www.triglex.com/~frain/cv/index.html). This page is under constant construction.

<br>
## General structure
This roadmap is rough and will be edited on weekly basis as I go through material. I structured it to follow my university program as much as possible so that I, for e.g., am not learning java while exams are using c++. It is primarly focused on software engineering. Roadmap is broken down into few major milestones (entry/junior level, regular/middle, intermediate, senior, later in career and other). It's closely tied to my [repositories](#repositories-and-pages), mainly to my [studying](https://github.com/frainfreeze/studying) repository.
<br>
General structure of this roadmap is as follows:
<br>
#### Learning plan
- what to do every single day, depending on current level

#### Lvl1 (entry/junior level)

## Learning plan
Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.
I also do small projects that sum up what I learned in last few days/weeks/months. Those get sorted into appropriate github repository.
I take subject from the list at the end of page, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in pure language without libraries or by using libraries. For eg:

    - C++ - without using built-in types
    - C++ - using built-in types, like STL's std::list for a linked list
    - Python
    - Other - other languages I will use later.

Why code in all of these?

    Practice, practice, practice, until I'm sick of it, and can do it with no problem (some have many edge cases and bookkeeping details to remember)
    Work within the raw constraints (allocating/freeing memory without help of garbage collection (except Python))
    Make use of built-in types so I have experience using the built-in tools for real-world use (not going to write my own linked list implementation in production)

I may not have time to do all of these for every subject, but I'll try.
Write code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then test it out on a computer.


- flash cards?

## Lvl1
#### **Beginning c++ through game programming**
A really good book to learn basics of C++ in an interactive way. Covers some basic and important topics like pointers and references along with some use of the Standard Template Library. Moves to some OOPs topics like inheritance and hierarchy
It covers a bit of AI programming, nothing near to bot-building algorithms or combinatorial search, but rather an introduction to thinking like an AI programmer.
Reference: https://frainfreeze.github.io/post/bcpptgp/

<br>
#### **Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++**
This is an introduction to programming for people who has never programmed before. It will also be useful for people who have programmed a bit and want to improve their style and technique - or simply learn modern C++. It is designed for classroom use, but written with an eye on self study.

<br>
### **-----------------------   courses   -----------------------**

#### **edX Microsoft: DEV210.2x - Intermediate C++, DEV210x - Introduction to C++**

<br>
#### **Udacity C++ For Programmers (ft. Bjarne Stroustrup)**
C++ for Programmers is designed for students who are familiar with a programming language and wish to learn C++.

This course focuses on 'how' as opposed to 'what'. For example, in the lesson on functions, we do not teach what a function is, but rather how to create a function in C++. The lessons are taught by several different instructors who have used C++ in their professional careers, so students get to experience different perspectives.

The course also includes comments and tips from Bjarne Stroustrup - the original designer of C++.

<br>
#### **Udemy C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners**

- Basic syntax (user input, types, conditions, loops, arrays...)
- Functions (headers and prototypes, return values and parameters...)
- Object oriented coding (classes, data members, constructors, getters...)
- Pointers and memory (pointers and arrays, references, constants, allocating memory...)
- Inheritance (encapsulation, constructor inheritance)
- Twos complement and static keyword
- Developing a program: particle fire simulation (using SDL library)
- Bonus (OOP design considerations, postfix & prefix, polymorphism, creating static libs)

<br>
## **Udemy Advanced C++ Programming**

- exceptions (standard, custom...)
- files (w/r/parse, structs and padding, binary files)
- STL (vectors, 2d arrays, lsits, maps and multimaps, sets, stacks, queues...)
- operator overloading
- template classes and functions
- passing functions to functions
- C++11 features (many)
- GUI programming
- A project: drawing fractal images (bitmaps, histograms, rgb classes...)
- Bonus (multiple inheritance)

### **--------------------------------------------------------------**

<br>
#### **The Self-taught Programmer by Cory Althoff**
very basic introduction to programming with Python together with a few very short chapters on all this "other stuff" that you need to know to actually write a program. This includes an explanation of object oriented programming and a brief comparison with functional and procedural programming, explanations of the bash command line, regular expressions, package managers such as github and the importance of data structures and algorithms.

The information is only suitable for a real beginner.

<br>
#### **Computer Science Distilled: Learn the Art of Solving Computational Problems**
A foolproof walkthrough of must-know computer science concepts. Designed for readers who don't need the academic formality, it's a fast and easy computer science guide. It teaches essential concepts for people who want to program computers effectively. First, it introduces discrete mathematics, then it exposes the most common algorithms and data structures. It also shows the principles that make computers and programming languages work.

Well written but very basic.

<br>
#### **The Mythical Man-Month**
This book is a classic, but recently revised and corrected. The amazing thing is how relevant the book still is to software product development. If you are involved in software, this book is a must-read. The most valuable part of the book, I believe, is the “plan to throw out” prototype chapter. While the goal is always to make a bigger, better, fast whatever, it is almost an axiom that you WILL build something that has to be discarded and reworked. This happens every time, I can tell you from first-hand experience. Therefore, it is vital to plan to throw out so you can migrate your users to whatever will follow. If you dream that the first product is THE ONE, you risk abandoning them on a product that will inevitably evolve. Planning to throw-away also helps meet the schedule goals by setting reasonable milestones that can be obtained. 

"Read all of this book. The classic software engineering book. It's a quick read, and it has stood the test of time (written over 25 years ago). This is about a week of reading." - Jay Baxter (circa 2009)

<br>
#### **Joel on Software: And on Diverse and Occasionally Related Matters That Will Prove of Interest to Software Developers, Designers, and Managers, and to Those Who, Whether by Good Fortune or Ill Luck, Work with Them in Some Capacity**
"Read all of this book. This is a collection of essays written by Joel over the course of a few years. Read them, they will give you insight into how good programmers think. Note that Joel Spolsky is often wrong on details (no one is perfect) but he nails the essence quite often. This is about a week of reading." - Jay Baxter (circa 2009)

<br>
#### **Programming Pearls**
This book is slightly different from the other books on the list. I would say this book helps a person “think like a programmer”. Programming Pearls is a compendium of 15 columns previously published in Communications of the ACM. The columns cover a broad range of topics related to programming: from requirements gathering to performance tuning. The focus is primarily on coding techniques and algorithms.
Each column has been reorganized as a chapter. Chapters usually start with the presentation of a practical problem. Then various solutions are presented and are used as lessons to be learned. The writing style is clear and fun.
Programming Pearls is not a usual book teaching new programming concepts. Although it contains good and sometimes quite novel ideas, the aim of the book is not to teach something new but to help you become a better problem solver.

"Optional. This is a great book with a lot of insight on programming problems and how to solve them. This will take about a month to work through. This is a bit more advanced than the rest of the books above." - Jay Baxter (circa 2009)

<br>
#### **Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software**
This book cleared up a lot of the “Magic” that goes into creating and developing complex systems. There are so many abstractions these days that the low-level details are sometimes unknown to the developer. Though you may not find yourself using this book 24/7 in practice…I believe it is a good idea to have an understanding of what you are building on top of and how the whole orchestration works. It may come in handy when you need to open up that “Black Box” and deep dive into the software or hardware to fix a pesky bug. “CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software” by Charles Petzold deals with a number of programming concepts starting from number systems – decimal, octal, binary to high-level languages. The book explains packet based communication protocols and TCP. Many chapters are about hardware concepts, and five chapters are devoted to software and teach about the operating system, floating point arithmetic, and GUIs.

<br><br>
## Lvl2
A mid-level engineer should have skills at the level indicated by these books. This is a big list. It's about a year of reading (kind where you read for several hours a day, every day). This list is roughly in the order they should be read, dividied in two parts, parts can be read in parallel. (todo: sort me better)

### pt1

<br>
#### **C++ primer**
very thorough introduction into C++ that covers just about everything in the language in a very accessible format and in great detail. 
(prvi put pročitati letimično tijekom ljeta i koristiti kao reference tokom slijedecih par godina)

<br>
#### **Introduction to algorithms**
This has to be the single best book for understanding and using algorithms (which you will be doing a lot of in software development). Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis, and randomized algorithms, and linear programming.

<br>
#### **A Tour of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup)**
The “tour” is a quick (about 180 pages and 14 chapters) tutorial overview of all of standard C++ (language and standard library, and using C++11) at a moderately high level for people who already know C++ or at least are experienced programmers. This book is an extended version of the material that constitutes Chapters 2-5 of The C++ Programming Language, 4th edition. "Grad overview of everything" - Stroustrup

<br>
#### **Accelerated C++ (Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo)**
This basically covers the same ground as the C++ Primer, but does so on a fourth of its space. This is large because it does not attempt to be an introduction to programming, but an introduction to C++ for people who've previously programmed in some other language. It has a steeper learning curve, but, for those who can cope with this, it is a very compact introduction to the language. (Historically, it broke new ground by being the first beginner's book to use a modern approach to teaching the language.)

<br>
#### **the c++ programing lang 4th ed (Bjarne Stroustrup)**
"For professional people who want to know everything" - Stroustrup

### **pt2**

#### **Object-Oriented Programming in C++ by Nicolai M. Josuttis**
"This is an excellent book on intermediate C++ programming. I do expect mid-level programmers to know everything in this book. Note: you can read the Eckel's two-volume set listed below instead; the two are roughly equivalent. This is probably three months of reading and working (you will write lots of little programs while reading this book, or you're not using it correctly)."

<br>
#### **Thinking in C++: Introduction to Standard C++, Volume One (2nd Edition) (Vol 1) by Bruce Eckel**
"Read all of both books. Good two-volume set on intermediate C++ programming. I do expect mid-level programmers to know everything in this book. Note: you can read the book by Josuttis instead of this set. This is about 3 to 5 months of reading and working."

<br>
#### **Thinking in C++, Volume 2: Practical Programming by Bruce Eckel**
"Read all of both books. Good two-volume set on intermediate C++ programming. I do expect mid-level programmers to know everything in this book. Note: you can read the book by Josuttis instead of this set. This is about 3 to 5 months of reading and working."

<br>
#### **Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman**
"Read all of this book. This is a very easy to read introduction to design patterns. It looks goofy, but it's a good book. This is 1-2 weeks of reading."

<br>
#### **User Interface Design for Programmers by Joel Spolsky**
"Read all of this book. Very quick read. Decent collection of design heuristics for doing user interface programming. This is about three days of reading."

<br>
#### **Debugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems by David J. Agans**
"Read all of this book. A entertaining and useful book on how to debug better. This is about two weeks of reading."

<br>
#### **Code Reading: The Open Source Perspective (v. 1) by Diomidis Spinellis**
"This book teaches you how to read code correctly. Highly recommended. It's all on open-source projects, because that's what the author could lay his hands on. This is about two months of reading if you read the whole thing."

<br>
#### **TCP/IP Sockets in C, Second Edition: Practical Guide for Programmers (Morgan Kaufmann Practical Guides) by Michael J. Donahoo**
"Optional. This is a short but sweet introduction to network programming with sockets. This is about a week of reading and programming."


<br><br>
## Lvl3
<br>
#### **Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction**
The number one book (IMHO) to read if you are going to be a great software engineer. Widely considered one of the best practical guides to programming, Steve McConnell’s original CODE COMPLETE has been helping developers write better software for more than a decade. Now this classic book has been fully updated and revised with leading-edge practices—and hundreds of new code samples—illustrating the art and science of software construction. Capturing the body of knowledge available from research, academia, and everyday commercial practice, McConnell synthesizes the most effective techniques and must-know principles into clear, pragmatic guidance. No matter what your experience level, development environment, or project size, this book will inform and stimulate your thinking—and help you build the highest quality code.

Discover the timeless techniques and strategies that help you:

- Design for minimum complexity and maximum creativity
- Reap the benefits of collaborative development
- Apply defensive programming techniques to reduce and flush out errors
- Exploit opportunities to refactor—or evolve—code, and do it safely
- Use construction practices that are right-weight for your project
- Debug problems quickly and effectively
- Resolve critical construction issues early and correctly
- Build quality into the beginning, middle, and end of your project

<br>
#### **Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship**
“A prospective employer told me to read this book if I wanted to learn a lot about writing code. He was right.
This book is general to the sense that it can teach to anyone programming in any language. My peers and I have noticed a tremendous improvement in the readability of code after going through this book. Even if you are experienced and feel like you know what you are doing, there are a lot of lessons you can learn through this book. It is a quick read and well worth your time.”

<br>
#### **The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers**
The book explores topics that programmers often ignore:

- What does being professional programmer mean?
- How to carry yourself as a true software craftsman
- Dealing with conflict and tight schedules
- How to manage your time? How can you expand your skills?
- When to say “No”
- Avoiding burnout
- ..and more.

<br>
#### **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software**
“If you are planning to be an architect or designer of a system, you will most likely be required to read this book. Hailed as one of the greatest software development books ever written, this book goes into great detail on the many different design patterns that have been developed over the years to help software engineers avoid and handle common problems that the industry faces. Following the strategies in this book will allow you to build higher quality, flexible, and maintainable software. This book also goes by the name “Gang of Four” in software groups because of its famous four authors that put this book together.”

<br>
#### **The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master**
 Though the book was written in 1999 (I believe), the concepts are the basis of how we go about developing a complex system in a practical manner. Programmers are craftspeople trained to use a certain set of tools (editors, object managers, version trackers) to generate a certain kind of product (programs) that will operate in some environment (operating systems on hardware assemblies). Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn’t taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they’ve discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.


<br><br>
## Lvl4
"This list is for people who want to become a Senior Software Engineer. I expect a senior to have all the skills indicated by these books (as well as all the skills indicated by the associate and mid-level lists). This is now a more general software engineering list, you'll note. There is so much for a mid-level to learn to become a senior, and yet I don't want 50 books on the list. I want a list where ALL gets read. This list is very much a work in progress. It's also a longer list - it's a three-year reading list (assuming you just got promoted to mid-level, it will take you about three years of dedicated work to make senior)."

#### **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**
With an analytical and rigorous approach to problem solving and programming techniques, this book is oriented toward engineering. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models. Its unique approach makes it appropriate for an introduction to computer science courses, as well as programming languages and program design. The book further explains the four best-known paradigms of programming languages – imperative, object-oriented, logic based and applicative programming.

<br>
#### **Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code**
“Refactoring” by Martin Fowler is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure. With refactoring, you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works The book is written using Java as its principal language, but the ideas apply to any OO language.

<br>
#### **Working Effectively with Legacy Code**
almost every software developer, at some point in their career, has to support and work with a legacy system. In this book, Michael Feathers offers start-to-finish strategies for working more effectively with large, untested legacy code bases. This book draws on material Michael created for his renowned Object Mentor seminars: techniques Michael has used in mentoring to help hundreds of developers, technical managers, and testers bring their legacy systems under control.

<br>
#### **Head First Software Development by Dan Pilone**
"This book is an easy-to-read overview of the entire software development process, as it is currently understood. This is not an in-depth book. It's your freshman introduction to what you've been doing for the past few years. This book will take a few days to a few weeks to read, depending on what you already know."

<br>
#### **The Practice of Programming (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) by Brian W. Kernighan**
"An introduction to programming by two of the big names in the programming field. Should be a quick read for a mid-level software engineer."

<br>
#### **Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices by Robert C. Martin**
"This is an important book. Read all of it carefully. There will be a quiz. This book will take you several months. This book is rare: engagingly written, easy to read, and foundational. This is the Java and C++ version of the book. A somewhat updated version is titled Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#; mostly the same but for .NET."

<br>
#### **Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin**
"This book seems like a low-end book, but it is not. It's actually a companion book to Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practices. Bob Martin calls this book the prequel, but you won't get the full value of this book without knowing the other book. The first half can be read in days; the second half of the book will take weeks, if you do it right."

<br><br>
## Lvl5
#### **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture**
This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts.
Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.

The topics covered include:

- Dividing an enterprise application into layers
- The major approaches to organizing business logic
- An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases
- Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation
- Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions
- Designing distributed object interfaces

<br>
#### **Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams**
If you have any legitimate aspirations to be a “Team Leader” in practice instead of in name only,
you need to pick up a copy of this book

## Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- gathering requirements for the problem
- talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
- coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:
[Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)

No whiteboard at home? That makes sense. I'm a weirdo and have a big whiteboard. Instead of a whiteboard, pick up a
large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice.

## Your Resume

- See Resume prep items in Cracking The Coding Interview and back of Programming Interviews Exposed


## Be thinking of for when the interview comes

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along with the lines of the items below. Have 2-3 answers for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing product.
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?

## Have questions for the interviewer

    (You may know answer to these but you want their opinion or team perspective)

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?


<br>

    Everything below this point is optional. By studying these, you'll get greater exposure to more CS concepts, and will be better prepared for any software engineering job. You'll be a much more well-rounded software engineer.

- ### Augmented Data Structures
    - [CS 61B Lecture 39: Augmenting Data Structures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_zksIj9O8_jc)

- ### Balanced search trees
    - Know least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - "Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passé, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.
        A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations
        to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena
    - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a
        balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up
        and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code.
        - splay tree: insert, search, delete functions
        If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
        - search and insertion functions, skipping delete
    - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets.
    - [Self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)

    - **AVL trees**
        - In practice:
            From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:
            The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly
            balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it
            attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language
            dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter).

    - **Splay trees**
        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking and file system code) etc.

    - **Red/black trees**
        - these are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below)
        - In practice:
            Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

    - **2-3 search trees**
        - In practice:
            2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).
        - You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

    - **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

    - **B-Trees**
        - fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor)
        - In Practice:
            B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.
