I find great joy in intersection of software engineering, security and people. I'm particularly interested in operations and managing. 

With over half a decade of experience I offer an extensive background in all things Unix, enthusiasm to learn new technologies, a thorough Computer Science background, as well as high quality standards. 

I implement scalable and reliable tools, design architectures and APIs, create proof-of-concept prototypes, and intuitively and quickly analyze existing architectures both for what works and what doesn't; I analyze threat landscapes and develop threat models, determine and dissect applicable metrics to derive realistic, impactful solutions focused on reducing the attack surface and increasing performance. I enjoy teaching/mentoring, offer strong interpersonal and communications skills, a curious and open mind, and very strong work ethics. 

Above all, I'm driven by developing solutions that have a long-term impact and solve real problems for all users.
