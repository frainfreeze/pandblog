<h1>Meditations - by Marcus Aurelius</h1>
<pre><code>ISBN: none, http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html
Tags: Philosophy, Ethics &amp; Morality, Stoicism

<p><strong>Description:</strong> <br> Meditations (Medieval Greek: Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν, translit. Ta eis heauton, literally &quot;things to one's self&quot;) is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Notes &amp; Quotes:</strong> <br> Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.</p>
<p>A cucumber is bitter. Throw it away. There are briars in the road. Turn aside from them. This is enough. Do not add, &quot;And why were such things made in the world?&quot; (VIII. 50, trans. George Long)</p>
<p>Soon you'll be ashes or bones. A mere name at most—and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale, trivial. (V. 33, trans. Gregory Hays)</p>
<p>Do not then consider life a thing of any value. For look at the immensity of time behind thee, and to the time which is before thee, another boundless space. In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations? (IV. 50, trans. George Long)</p>

<h1>Deep work: rules for focused success in a distracted world</h1>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> <br> One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</p>
<p><strong>Notes &amp; Quotes:</strong> <br> How to get rid of the shiny object syndrome explained through series of essays.</p>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.</p>
<p>When Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built a retreat in the woods.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The idea</h2>
<h4>Deep work is valuable:</h4>
<p><strong>Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy</strong> <br></p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to quickly master hard things. <br></li>
<li>The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)</p>
<p>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.</p>
<h4>Deep work is rare: <br></h4>
<p><strong>The Principle of Least Resistance</strong>: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity</strong>: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.</p>
<h4>Deep work is meaningful - neurological, psychological, philosophical argument:</h4>
<p>&quot;Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavioral economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.&quot; Winifred Gallagher</p>
<p>“The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title), &quot;Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.&quot;</p>
<p>In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. “The Enlightenment’s metaphysical embrace of the autonomous individual leads not just to a boring life,” Dreyfus and Kelly worry; “it leads almost inevitably to a nearly unlivable one.”</p>
<h3>Part 2: The rules</h3>
<p>Rule #1 will teach you how to integrate deep work into your schedule and support it with routines and rituals designed to help you consistently reach the current limit of your concentration ability. Rule #2 will help you significantly improve this limit.</p>
<h4>Rule #1: Work deeply</h4>
<p>Eudaimonia Machine</p>
<p>Monastic Philosophy - remove all distractions <br> Bimodal Philosophy - alternate between deep work (monastic) and shallow everyday life <br> Rhythmic Philosophy - chain method; transform deep work sessions into regular habit</p>
<p>The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.</p>
<p>Deep work ritual questions: <br> Where you’ll work and for how long. (office with shut door and clear desk) How you’ll work once you start to work. (no internet/words per minute) How you’ll support your work. (food/water/coffee)</p>
<p>Grand gesture - By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.</p>
<p>4DX framework: <br> Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important <br> Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures <br> Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard <br> Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability <br></p>
<p>Downtime strategy (art, music, literature and exercise): <br> Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights <br> Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply <br> Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important</p>
<h4>Rule #2: Embrace boredom</h4>
<p>Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.</p>
<p>Productive meditation: take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls. Be Wary of Distractions and Looping. Structure Your Deep Thinking.</p>
<p>Memorize a Deck of Cards</p>
<h4>Rule #3: Quit social media</h4>
<p>Don’t formally deactivate these services, and (this is important) don’t mention online that you’ll be signing off: Just stop using them, cold turkey. After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit: <br></p>
<ol>
<li>Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? <br></li>
<li>Did people care that I wasn’t using this service? <br> If your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself</p>
<h4>Rule #4: Drain the Shallows</h4>
<p><strong>Schedule every minute of your day:</strong> Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Finish Your Work by Five Thirty:</strong> fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration.</p>
<h1>Patterns of Software</h1>
<pre><code>ISBN: 978-0195102697
Tags: Autobiography, Software
Date read: 1.7.2018.
Rating: 2.5/5</code></pre>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <br> In this wide-ranging volume, Gabriel discusses such topics as what makes a successful programming language, how the rest of the world looks at and responds to the work of computer scientists, how he first became involved in computer programming and software development, what makes a successful software business, and why his own company, Lucid, failed in 1994, ten years after its inception.</p>
<p><strong>Notes &amp; Quotes:</strong> <br> Collection of essays. Book can be divided into two parts: author's views on software engineering issues, and his biography. Not useful from software engineering point, out dated, but its quick read that provides few interesting thoughts and anecdotes.</p>
