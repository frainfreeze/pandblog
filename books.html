<p><strong>Description:</strong> <br><br />
Meditations (Medieval Greek: Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν, translit. Ta eis heauton,<br />
literally &quot;things to one's self&quot;) is a series of personal writings<br />
by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD, recording his<br />
private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Notes &amp; Quotes:</strong> <br><br />
Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a<br />
perspective, not the truth. How much time he gains who does not look<br />
to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he<br />
does himself, to make it just and holy.</p>
<p>A cucumber is bitter. Throw it away. There are briars in the road.<br />
Turn aside from them. This is enough. Do not add, &quot;And why were such<br />
things made in the world?&quot; (VIII. 50, trans. George Long)</p>
<p>Soon you'll be ashes or bones. A mere name at most—and even that is<br />
just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale,<br />
trivial. (V. 33, trans. Gregory Hays)</p>
<p>Do not then consider life a thing of any value. For look at the<br />
immensity of time behind thee, and to the time which is before thee,<br />
another boundless space. In this infinity then what is the difference<br />
between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations?<br />
(IV. 50, trans. George Long)</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> <br><br />
One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</p>
<p><strong>Notes &amp; Quotes:</strong> <br><br />
How to get rid of the shiny object syndrome explained through series of essays.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>
<p>Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he<br />
would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big<br />
thoughts.</p>
<p>When Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built a retreat in<br />
the woods.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-the-idea">Part 1: The idea</h2>
<h4 id="deep-work-is-valuable">Deep work is valuable:</h4>
<p><strong>Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy</strong> <br></p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to quickly master hard things. <br></li>
<li>The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)</p>
<p>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full<br />
concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type<br />
of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.</p>
<h4 id="deep-work-is-rare">Deep work is rare: <br></h4>
<p><strong>The Principle of Least Resistance</strong>: In a business setting, without clear feedback<br />
on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors<br />
that are easiest in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity</strong>: In the absence of clear indicators of what it<br />
means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back<br />
toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.</p>
<h4 id="deep-work-is-meaningful---neurological-psychological-philosophical-argument">Deep work is meaningful - neurological, psychological, philosophical argument:</h4>
<p>&quot;Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to<br />
education, behavioral economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful<br />
management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving<br />
virtually every aspect of your experience.&quot; Winifred Gallagher</p>
<p>“The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits<br />
in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi<br />
calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title),<br />
&quot;Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities<br />
they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to<br />
become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the<br />
other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something<br />
that can be enjoyed.&quot;</p>
<p>In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and<br />
what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism.<br />
“The Enlightenment’s metaphysical embrace of the autonomous individual leads not just to<br />
a boring life,” Dreyfus and Kelly worry; “it leads almost inevitably to a nearly unlivable<br />
one.”</p>
<h3 id="part-2-the-rules">Part 2: The rules</h3>
<p>Rule #1 will teach you how to integrate deep work into your schedule and support it with<br />
routines and rituals designed to help you consistently reach the current limit of your<br />
concentration ability. Rule #2 will help you significantly improve this limit.</p>
<h4 id="rule-1-work-deeply">Rule #1: Work deeply</h4>
<p>Eudaimonia Machine</p>
<p>Monastic Philosophy - remove all distractions <br><br />
Bimodal Philosophy - alternate between deep work (monastic) and shallow everyday life <br><br />
Rhythmic Philosophy - chain method; transform deep work sessions into regular habit</p>
<p>The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines<br />
and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower<br />
necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.</p>
<p>Deep work ritual questions: <br><br />
Where you’ll work and for how long. (office with shut door and clear desk)<br />
How you’ll work once you start to work. (no internet/words per minute)<br />
How you’ll support your work. (food/water/coffee)</p>
<p>Grand gesture - By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps<br />
with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep<br />
work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.</p>
<p>4DX framework: <br><br />
Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important <br><br />
Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures <br><br />
Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard <br><br />
Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability <br></p>
<p>Downtime strategy (art, music, literature and exercise): <br><br />
Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights <br><br />
Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply <br><br />
Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important</p>
<h4 id="rule-2-embrace-boredom">Rule #2: Embrace boredom</h4>
<p>Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.</p>
<p>Productive meditation: take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not<br />
mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single<br />
well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might<br />
be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting<br />
to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to<br />
bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.<br />
Be Wary of Distractions and Looping. Structure Your Deep Thinking.</p>
<p>Memorize a Deck of Cards</p>
<h4 id="rule-3-quit-social-media">Rule #3: Quit social media</h4>
<p>Don’t formally deactivate these services, and (this is important) don’t mention online<br />
that you’ll be signing off: Just stop using them, cold turkey. After thirty days of this<br />
self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of<br />
the services you temporarily quit: <br></p>
<ol>
<li>Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? <br></li>
<li>Did people care that I wasn’t using this service? <br><br />
If your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself</p>
<h4 id="rule-4-drain-the-shallows">Rule #4: Drain the Shallows</h4>
<p><strong>Schedule every minute of your day:</strong> Divide the hours of your workday into<br />
blocks and assign activities to the blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Finish Your Work by Five Thirty:</strong> fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal<br />
of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies<br />
that allow me to satisfy this declaration.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> <br><br />
In this wide-ranging volume, Gabriel discusses such topics as what makes<br />
a successful programming language, how the rest of the world looks at<br />
and responds to the work of computer scientists, how he first became<br />
involved in computer programming and software development, what makes a<br />
successful software business, and why his own company, Lucid, failed<br />
in 1994, ten years after its inception.</p>
<p><strong>Notes &amp; Quotes:</strong> <br><br />
Collection of essays. Book can be divided into two parts:<br />
author's views on software engineering issues, and his biography.<br />
Not useful from software engineering point, out dated, but its<br />
quick read that provides few interesting thoughts and anecdotes.</p>
